	title: `Iiris Pursiainen BA (Hons) Fine Art.`,
	subtitle: `A Finnish artist living in Wales.`,
	statement: `Since gaining my art degree I have experimented with many different methods of making art, such as painting, photography, print-making, collages, fabric-wrapping assemblages, papier coupe. The last couple of years have been a time of mostly making marks and objects by using traditional handicraft methods and materials. These include hand-sewing and machine-sewing on paper, on fabrics, and on painted paper surfaces. My large knitting project, consisting of about 150 strips and panels, continues to grow, until I decide what it is!`,
